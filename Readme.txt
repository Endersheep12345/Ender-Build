Known bugs/issues:

-Muted Fade/Electrical sfx to fix being too loud
-Random T-posing/crashes/freezes
-Incorrect stock icons in SSS when selected team battle (Since Brawl originally use colour teams instead of outline)
-Music will suddenly pause for a momment and continue for unknown reasons
-Since not all Ultimate costumes/models are ported to Brawl, or not enough since PM has 10 slots while Ultimate being 8, not all costumes are replaced and some are made.
-Chosing SSE will freeze the game, since I removed it to make game filesize smaller
-Other Gamemodes (Classic, Events, Stadium etc.) sometimes crash
-Additional PMCC character slots are sometimes buggy

*Lyn, replaced with Ridley
*Isaac, replaced with Simon/Richter
*Sami, replaced with Megaman
*Knuckles, replaced with Joker

-Mario's stock icon in SSS will show a ? stock icon, since PM use Mario's stock icon for individual stocks with the ? stock icon for some reason
-Simon/Richter sometimes can't throw the axe and Holy Water in their B and Side B respectively
